# Connect Four – Real-Time Multiplayer Game

A real-time implementation of the classic **Connect Four (4 in a Row)** game, built with a backend-driven architecture.  
Players can compete against each other in real time or play against a **competitive bot** when no opponent is available.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-Time Multiplayer**  
  Play against another player using WebSockets with instant board updates.

- **Automatic Matchmaking**  
  - Players are matched automatically.
  - If no opponent joins within **10 seconds**, the game starts against a bot.

- **Single-Player vs Bot**  
  The bot uses a priority-based strategy:
  - Win if possible
  - Block opponent’s winning move
  - Prefer the center column
  - Choose the first valid column otherwise

- **Reconnect Support**  
  Players can reconnect within **30 seconds** after disconnecting.  
  If they don’t, the opponent wins by default.

- **Leaderboard**  
  - Tracks total wins per player.
  - Exposed via a backend API.
  - Displayed on the frontend after games finish.

- **Simple Frontend UI**  
  Minimal React-based interface focused on functionality rather than styling.
